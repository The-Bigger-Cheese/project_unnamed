# PROJECT_UNNAMED

how to change your Save Key:
1. rename the `data_{save_key}` file to include your desired Save Key.
2. do the same with the journal and lab files, if they exist. if they don't, don't worry about them. they will have the new save key when created.
3. change the Save Key on the first line of the data file.
make sure they are all the same, otherwise data won't load properly.
